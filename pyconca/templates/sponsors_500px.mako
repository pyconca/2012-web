<h2>Oleg Gutsol, CEO 500px<h2>

<h3>
Tell me about you and your cofounders. 
How did you meet? How did you decide to found 500px?
</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://500px.com/">500px</a> was launched in late 2009 by me and 
Evgeny Tchebotarev. 

The idea though goes back to 2004 when we launched a blog dedicated to the 
best photography in the world.

Then, one of the requirements for uploaded photos was the width of 500 
pixels, hence the name of the blog.

Since launching the site, the requirement was dropped, but we kept the
name, because it people got to know 500px to be the place for great
photography.
</p>

<p>
Evgeny and I met in Toronto quite a while ago and connected through a
common interest in motorcycles.
</p>

<h3>
What other companies have you founded? 
How did that experience help you at 500px?
</h3>

<p>
Evgeny was a hired CEO at the Moscow startup called Temarium, which
was a blogging platform. 

Unfortunately, it is now shutdown. 

While studying at Ryerson, I founded GSM Toronto, an online marketplace for 
mobile phones. 

I also got out of that business after my co-founder left the company.
</p>

<p>
I think both of us soft of always knew that we would not be able to
work for someone or some large corporation, so we had to start
something ourselves. So we did :)
</p>

<h3>Why did you choose to start a company in Toronto?</h3>

<p>
We both lived in Toronto, so we didn't really choose. 

Although in the early days we considered moving to some place warm and 
cheap (Thailand was the one we discussed), but decided against it.
</p>

<h3>In your own words, what is 500px's mission?</h3>

<p>
500px mission is to the create the highest quality online photography 
platform in the world.
</p>

<h3>
What do you see as your biggest technological challenges in the next 1-2 years?
</h3>

<p>
I think scalability will always be our biggest challenge, data storage and 
real time retrieval and processing. 

Also, we are looking to address problems like image recognition, 
recommendations, discovery and popularity algorithms.
</p>

<h3>
Tell us a bit about the technologies / platform you're using now.
</h3>

<p>
We are using lots of different things, among them: Ruby, Python, 
Java, Objective-C, Lua, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Memcache. Also, things 
like riak and Hadoop in the future.
</p>

<h3>
Why did you choose to sponsor PyCon Canada?
</h3>

<p>
Being a company that uses the technology we want to be an active member of 
the Python community in Canada. 

Also, <a href="http://500px.com/jobs">we are looking for great developers</a>,
so PyCon is a great opportunity to connect with the great Python devs.
</p>

<h3>
What other things are you passionate about besides your mission at 500px?
</h3>

<p>
Personally, I am passionate about psychology and excellent user experience.
I also like things like motorcycles and snowboarding :)
