            The schedule for PyCon 2012 includes talks, tutorials, and sprints
            over Saturday and Sunday.
        </p>

        <p>
            We welcome <em>everyone</em> in the Canadian Python community to
            come and share your ideas, experiences, and expertise. Whether
            you’re new to Python or a seasoned expert, if you’ve got something
            interesting to share, we want to hear about it. A conference with a
            diverse set of good topics will give everyone the opportunity to
            learn something new and cool.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nervous about your lack of presenter experience? We’ll work to
            connect you with resources and people to help you prepare. You
            might also consider co-presenting with a more experienced
            presenter. And once you’ve rocked PyCon Canada 2012, you can take
            that experience to help you gear up for the main PyCon conference
            in Montréal.

        <h1 class="header">Submitting a Talk or Tutorial</h1>
        <p>
            We would prefer 20 minute talks, although 45 minute talks will also
            be considered. Tutorials are 3 hours. We also welcome ideas for
            sprints.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="/new/talk">Submit your talk</a> if you are logged in.
          Alternatively, you can send talk and tutorial proposals to
          <a href="mailto:organizers@pycon.ca">organizers@pycon.ca</a>. Include
          the following information in talk and tutorial proposals:
