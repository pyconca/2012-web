      <h1 class="header">Getting to Toronto</h1>
      <p>
        Toronto has 2 major airports.
        <a href="http://www.gtaa.com">Pearson</a> is the international airport
        and is the location for almost all the major domestic and international
        airlines. It’s about a 35 minute drive from the Airport to Beverley
        Halls, but be aware that downtown Toronto traffic is busy all day and
        is particularly busy during peak rush hour. Allow at least an hour for
        travel time from the airport.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="http://www.flyporter.com">Porter Airlines</a> is located on
        Toronto Island and is just south of Union Station, the main transit hub
        in downtown Toronto, including Go Transit, TTC (the local bus,
        streetcar and subway service) and VIA Rail.
      </p>

      <p>
        VIA is a good alternative to the airlines if you are coming from
        somewhere like Montréal or Ottawa. Advance pricing is often available
        at a discount.

            Make sure that you’ve got a valid passport and don’t forget to
            bring it with you.

            <a href="http://www.flyporter.com">Porter Airlines</a> has
            frequent, reasonably-priced flights for trips from several US
            cities to Toronto, including Boston, Burlington (VT), Chicago,
            Myrtle Beach, New York, and Washington
